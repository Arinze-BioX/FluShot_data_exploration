# FluShot_data_exploration
This repo is the first for the BME590 Introduction to Data Science project. Here, we will explore the structure and properties of the FluShot dataset present at https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/66/flu-shot-learning/
We would also design machine learning models for this dataset.
